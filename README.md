# friend-finder
The goal is to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I ran out of time to submit, not sure if my gitignore is right, don't have time to look back 

Here is the link to my heroku app that I got working yesterday in class (Ryo can attest to the hardships I had trying to get it to work) : https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/radiant-spire-76998


When I initially submitted this I was a little frustrated and down-trodden, so maybe ignore comments that are super sassy. I was glad to hear I wasn't the only one who experienced difficulty during this assignment.
